So...
Sth you could encounter while trying to setup this webpage

You tried to initialize the server in Terminal with
node server\server.js

Most likely, the error will be in this part

const dbConfig = {
  user: 'Your_Username',
  password: 'Your_Password',
  database: 'CyberGaming',
  options: {
    encrypt: false,
    trustServerCertificate: true
  }
};

Resolves:
Create a user profile in SQL Server (In SMSS)
Grant full permission to the user profile
